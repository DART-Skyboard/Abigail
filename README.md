This project demonstrates a basic integration of Google's `<model-viewer>` component with Three.js. The page loads a GLB model, attaches interactive hotspots for specific mesh names obtained from a remote script, and displays information popups.

Features include:
- Exporting the rendered canvas as PNG.
- Downloading the GLB model.
- AR support using WebXR / Scene Viewer / Quick Look.
- Hotspots that fetch and display neutron, proton and electron counts.
- "Dismiss All" button to hide all popups.

The project is intended as a simple example and may require additional styling and data sources for production use.
